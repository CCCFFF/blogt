      <h2>I received a letter from the IRS, what should I do?</h2>
<p>Contact us right away for a consultation. Requests from the IRS and other taxing authorities have timelines for replies and penalties could be assessed for late responses.</p>
<h2>How much will the consultation cost?</h2>

<h2>How can the IRS collect money from me or my company?</h2>
<p>The IRS can file a federal tax lien against all your assets; levy your bank accounts and/or wages; seize your home, investments, retirement, cars, business, or anything of value and dispose of them through an auction sale.</p>

<h2>What is an Offer in Compromise?</h2>
<p>An Offer in Compromise (OIC) is an agreement whereby the IRS agrees to accept less than what they are owed from a taxpayer.</p>
<h2>Am I qualified for an Offer in Compromise?</h2>
<p>Contact us to see if you qualify. There are specific IRS standards regarding eligibility including ratios of Income vs Expenses and assets that may be available for liquidation. Working with a tax professional can make a big difference when preparing an Offer in Compromise. According to a recent report from the National Taxpayer Advocate, almost one quarter of all OICs submitted were rejected because they were filled out incorrectly, and of the applications that were initially accepted for processing, almost half were later rejected.</p>
<h2>How long will the recovery process take?</h2>
<p>Some steps, such as stopping levies and seizures may happen relatively quickly. However, the entire process of an Offer in Compromise can take several months to over a year or more.</p>
